Results from models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Random Forest show differing levels of performance across several assessment measures. On both the cross-validation and test sets, MNB obtained reasonably high values for accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score. SVM performed competitively, however it was a little bit less accurate and recall than MNB. KNN, on the other hand, showed reduced precision and accuracy, highlighting its limits for sentiment analysis in this situation. The models of Decision Tree and Random Forest performed in an intermediate manner; Random Forest performed better than Decision Tree, particularly in terms of accuracy. Although XGBoost demonstrated a trade-off between recall and accuracy, overall performance was good. In terms of sentiment analysis, these conventional machine learning models fared rather well overall.
